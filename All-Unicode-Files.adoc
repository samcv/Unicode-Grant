== Key
* NameofFile.txt _N/A-to-Perl6_
** The name of the file as seen at URL
** Will show _N/A-to-Perl6_ if its contents are not needed as a *data source*
    or as a *test source*.
* TASK: Task-name-here
** The name of the task that this data file is associated with for this
    Grant's work.

* Perl6-TEST-STATUS: N/A
** shows status of a *test data* document being implemented in Perl 6
* Perl6-TEST-STATUS: InProjectRepo
** Meaning that the test is done and in this repository
* UniProp_DATA: _Property_Name_
** Shows what properties are included in a *source data* document.

=== List of Canonical Aliases

==== PropertyAliases.txt
** Alias names of Unicode property _names_ to other canonical property names.
** We need this because Perl 6 should accept any canonical property name alias
          Aside: can/should be case insensitive and nonsensitive to underscores
          _graphemeclusterbreak_ should be work for _Grapheme_Cluster_Break_
** *NOT* guaranteed to be unique and several property aliases are also
    unrelated property values
** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: https://github.com/samcv/Unicode-Grant/blob/master/t/PropertyAliases.t[In Progress]

==== PropertyValueAliases.txt
** Similar to Property name aliases (see item above), except this is for
    property *values*. They should be interchangable as well.
** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: https://github.com/samcv/Unicode-Grant/blob/master/t/PropertyValueAliases.t[In Progress]

==== NameAliases.txt

==== ArabicShaping.txt
** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: https://github.com/samcv/Unicode-Grant/blob/master/t/ArabicShaping.t[InProjectRepo]
** UniProp_DATA: `Joining_Type`, `Joining_Group`
** “__This file defines the Joining_Type and Joining_Group property
  values for Arabic, Syriac, N'Ko, Mandaic, and Manichaean positional
  shaping, repeating in machine readable form the information
  exemplified in Tables 9-3, 9-8, 9-9, 9-10, 9-14, 9-15, 9-16, 9-19,
  9-20, 10-4, 10-5, 10-6, 10-7, and 19-5 of The Unicode Standard core
  specification. This file also defines Joining_Type values for
  Mongolian, Phags-pa, and Psalter Pahlavi positional shaping, which
  are not listed in tables in the standard.__”

=== auxiliary/

==== GraphemeBreakProperty.txt
*** UniProp_DATA: `Grapheme_Cluster_Break`
*** One of the most important properties. Almost exclusively defines
        how we break up codepoints into graphemes.

==== GraphemeBreakTest.html
*** TASK: GraphemeClusterBreak[GraphemeClusterBreak]
*** Has a table which shows a matrix of how GCB properties interact with
        each other. http://www.unicode.org/Public/9.0.0/ucd/auxiliary/GraphemeBreakTest.html[9.0 Online]

==== GraphemeBreakTest.txt
** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: [X] Home#roast-new-version-of-graphemebreaktestt[Merged. ROAST_TESTING]
*** Important test for checking how Graphemes breakup
**** check breaking them up arbitrarily. I.E.
        instead of just checking on the total numbers, check when you .substr them
** LineBreakTest.html
** LineBreakTest.txt
*** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: N/A
*** Perl 6 has access to the Sentence_Break property, but the test is
        not needed because we don't break up text by sentences in Perl 6.
** SentenceBreakProperty.txt `Sentence_Break`
** SentenceBreakTest.html N/A-to-Perl6
** SentenceBreakTest.txt N/A-to-Perl6
*** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: N/A
*** Perl 6 has access to the Sentence_Break property, but the test is
        not needed because we don't break up text by sentences in Perl 6.

** WordBreakProperty.txt `Word_Break`
** WordBreakTest.html NA
** WordBreakTest.txt NA
*** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: NA

== Mirroring

=== BidiMirroring.txt
** UniProp: `Bidi_Paired_Bracket` `Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph`
** Glyphs which should be mirrored and their mirrored counterparts (when switching from LTR or RTL text)
** Also includes a list of codepoints which have no mirrored pair, but should be mirrored (by flipping).

=== BidiBrackets.txt #Data
** UniProp: `Bidi_Paired_Bracket_Type`
** Perl6-TEST-STATUS: https://github.com/samcv/Unicode-Grant/blob/master/t/BidiBrackets.t[Failing in this repo]
** Subset of BidiMirroringGlyph. And only includes brackets.
** **Note** does not include matched quotation marks.

* BidiCharacterTest.txt N/A
** *This file provides a conformance test for implementations of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, specified in UAX \#9: Unicode.
    Bidirectional Algorithm, at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/*
** Focuses on reordering of text from a single line

* BidiTest.txt #N/A
** Tests conformance to Unicode BA focusing on more than a single line

* Blocks.txt
** Data: Block
* CaseFolding.txt
** This file is a supplement to the UnicodeData file.
        It provides a case folding mapping generated from the Unicode Character Database.
        If all characters are mapped according to the full mapping below, then
        case differences (according to UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt)
        are eliminated.

        and Shift-JIS codes for cell phone carrier symbols on the other hand.

* ReadMe.txt
* ScriptExtensions.txt `Script_Extensions` http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/#Assignment_ScriptX_Values[TR]
** *Status*: Unsupported
** Values are an unordered set for codepoints that have this property.
    Can be one or more of the many Scripts. As of Unicode 9.0 the number of items
    in the set from 1-17 different scripts. Most have 1 or 2 scripts (mode).
* Scripts.txt UniProp_DATA: `Script` http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/[TR]
** The `Script` of the codepoint. This can only have one value unlike
    the `scx` property.
